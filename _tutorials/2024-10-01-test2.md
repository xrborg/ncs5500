Last but not least, to print debugs, a process would always require some kind of trigger, such as the reception of a control plane packet on process level



<div class="notice--info">
### Key Takeaways:
- Run by a CPU process at application level.
- Easy to use with a similar syntax across different platforms.
- Often very verbose, and sometimes not very granular.
- Display data, very specific to a given process.
- Require a valid trigger to display a debug message.
