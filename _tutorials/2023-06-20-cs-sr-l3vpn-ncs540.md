## Overview

Circuit-style segment routing provides deterministic behaviour for routed traffic, making it particularly suitable for use cases that require persistent co-routed bidirectional paths, guaranteed bandwidth, and end-to-end path protection. The use cases we will be addressing here pertain to Utility WAN substation automation. We will cover L3VPN (SCADA) and L2VPN (Ethernet Teleprotection) services with CS-SR as part of the wider tutorial series. To flag off the series, let us start with static CS-SR policy provisioning for L3VPN SCADA service.
