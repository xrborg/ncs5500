## Overview

Circuit-style segment routing provides deterministic behaviour for routed traffic, making it particularly suitable for use cases that require persistent co-routed bidirectional paths, guaranteed bandwidth, and end-to-end path protection. The use cases we will be addressing here pertain to Utility WAN substation automation. We will cover L3VPN (SCADA) and L2VPN (Ethernet Teleprotection) services with CS-SR as part of the wider tutorial series. To flag off the series, let us start with static CS-SR policy provisioning for L3VPN SCADA service.

## Topology & Use Case

| Nodes | Device Type | Software Version  |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| PE1   |  NCS 540    | IOS XR 7.9.1      |
| P2    |  NCS 540    | IOS XR 7.9.1      |
| P3    |  NCS 540    | IOS XR 7.9.1      |
| PE4   |  NCS 540    | IOS XR 7.9.1      |
| CE1   |  IR 8340    | IOS XE 17.12.1    |
| CE2   |  ASR 1002   | IOS XE 17.9.3a    |

We are using a mix of routers across the NCS540 portfolio as the PEs and WAN core routers. To establish connectivity between the WAN substation and the control center, the CE IR8340 is deployed as a substation router connected to an RTU (Remote Terminal Unit), while the CE ASR-1002 headend router is connected to the control center.
